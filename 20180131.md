# Wisdom

Good evening Flatland Student Ministry, it is an absolute honor every time I get to talk to you guys on a Wednesday night. Let me just say I am so excited about this series, I'm excited to see what God is going to do through each and every one of you as a result of this series. I think that as we dive into the craziness that is Guyland and Girland and we view all of that through the lens of Ephesians chapter 5 that a paradigm shift is going to happen in this youth ministry that is going to change the way you approach life.
Last week Naomi gave an powerful message on sexuality and God's design for it and how we need to ultimately choose a little awkward pain now to avoid life altering pain in the future. And the week before the Rob talked about identity and how we need to view ourselves as God's child.

This week we're going to be talking about wisdom, and specifically spending our time wisely. So before we get too much farther I want us to dive right into scripture, so turn with me in your Bible's to Ephesians 5:15-17.

> Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.

## Me

I am a time waster. Plain and simple. I *love* working on projects and building new things, and I love to work. I should say I love to work on things that I love to work on. It's funny because there are things I really enjoy working on. Like at work there is a very specific area of my job that I am very passionate about. We'll call it making widgets, cause if I'm being honest I don't have twenty minutes to explain RESTful web services and why they're far superior to non-REST-based APIs with maybe the exception of GraphQL which while beautiful is generally overkill in almost every use case. So let's, for the sake of simplicity say that I love making widgets at work. And any time I get to make a widget instead of say, a gadget, I'm over the moon. And everyone I work with knows that I really like working with widgets. Making widgets comes very naturally to me so I really don't have to spend a lot of time making the widgets. The problem that I have, is that I know that I don't need a ton of time to make the widget. So instead of making the widget quickly, I put off the widget for a few hours and maybe read an article about better widgets, or write unrelated widgets for something else. And before I know it, a whole day has gone by and that really easy to build widget is still left undone.

I tend to be like this with my relationship with God too. I really love the Bible, I think it's such a rich and amazing book. I've been reading through it with one of my good friends and we try to meet once a week to go over what we read. But instead of spending each morning reading a little bit, I'll play a game on my phone, or I'll scroll through reddit for an hour, or I'll play around writing a new widget, or I'll binge watch the Office for the fourth time.

In fact just the other week my life group and I were talking about how we were growing closer to God and I realized how as much as I have every desire to be moving closer to God and growing spiritually, I haven't been spending my time wisely. In fact, God really convicted me recently and said that I was being selfish with my time. I am in love with the idea of growing closer to him, but haven't spent the time loving him.

## You

You live in one of the most distracting periods of time in human history. Your attention is literally a commodity that is bought and sold by large corporations. I recently read a study that showed that when you read a blog post or news article on, less than 6% of what is actually hitting your eyes is the content of the article. The other 94% consists of external ads that a company is being paid to show you, or other content from the same company trying to keep you on their platform.

Facebook has been notorious about this with their infinitely scrolling video player. They'll play you 5 or 6 videos in a row just so they can show you a 5 second advertisement for Old Spice. It's such a crazy world we're living in. Netflix is expected to spend anywhere between $8-16 billion this year to create original content that will vie for your time and attention.
What's crazy is that in 2018 its easier than ever to access free resources to uplift and edify you. For a few bucks you can learn a trade, or become a graphic designer or computer programmer without ever leaving your house. You can explore world history for hours for free on YouTube and get incredible free resources on spiritual disciplines and Biblical studies with the click of a button. But more than ever you are forced to choose how to spend your time down to smallest moment.

There was a time when pastors were concerned with the impact that novels, like Tom Sawyer, Frankenstein, and the Three Musketeers were having on Christians. And now we live in a time when it's considered completely acceptable to spend 16 hours of your Saturday binging through 13 Reasons or Stranger Things. And don't get me wrong. I've totally done it.

But how many of you feel like your time is being wasted? Like you're losing hours of your time to tv and social media and pointless games? How many times have you sat in that seat when someone has told you to be reading your Bible or praying more and your first thought was, well I would if I could Matt but honestly, I don't have time.

## God

Gosh at this point you might be feeling pretty stressed out. I have so much on my plate between school and work and trying to keep up a social life and chores and parents and homework and let's not forget that I'm like two shows behind on whatever it is Marvel's doing on Netflix right now. How on Earth can I even fit time for God in there.

Looking back at our verse Paul says, "...making the best use of your time, because the days are evil. Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is." I think one of the biggest lies that both Guyland and Girland tell us is that our time is our own. That time is something *we* are meant to manage and control and manipulate so that we can have the best social life and experience the best entertainment and make the most money. But I love what Matthew Henry, an old Bible commentator, said in reference to this verse, "Time is a talent given to us by God and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to his design."

Time is God's, and it is a gift he's given us. On page one of the Bible we see God creating the heavens and the earth, and he creates lights in the sky to govern day and night and to know when days and years and seasons and festivals were to happen. Time is something he designed and created for us. As a gift. And he wants us to use the gift wisely. He wants us to use the gift of 16 waking hours 7 days a week 52 weeks a year (5824 hrs) to accomplish his will.

But what is God's will? What is his will for me? How can I know God's will. I think there are two answers to that question. The first answer is what some people call the General Will of God, God's desire for all people everywhere in all times and space. And that's that people would be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth, that people would not just be saved but would move closer to the center of His kingdom to be come more like Him. And that they would teach others to do the same.
Then there is what's called God's specific will. And that's his will for you, and you, and you. It's what some people would term a calling and others a purpose or a life goal. It's that driving destination that God is dying for you to take hold of and run with.

It's funny because as I was spending time marinating in this verse I felt something really clearly from God. You cannot know what his will is for your life unless you spend time seeking his will for your life. It's almost cyclical. The verse says that you shouldn't waste your time because the days are evil and don't be foolish but understand God's will for your life. Listen, lean in, focus on so intently on what God wants for your life. And the only way to do that is to spend focused time with the creator of the universe.

Three weeks ago this past Monday the CEO at my company told me that my position was being removed and that I had four weeks to find a new job. For those keeping score at home that means that this coming Monday would be my first Monday without a job. So I immediately started applying for jobs. In fact I applied for about 30 different jobs with unique cover letters for each position. I had probably about 5 or 6 interviews and plenty of knows. Meanwhile, in the background, the recruiter that helped me land my current job was also trying to get me interviews. The whole time I felt like God was saying, Hey Matt, I've got this. I've never let you down before, I've always been faithful and provided, just trust me with this. I've _got_ this. But I didn't listen. So I wasted time pursuing jobs instead of pursuing God.

Then Winter Retreat happened. I don't know how many of you still remember that third session with Bruce when the Holy Spirit was moving through that chapel. And I heard God remind me, Not one promise that I have given you has failed. Every one has been fulfilled. I will give you a job. And so I completely let go and decided to focus on God. I spent more time in prayer and Bible study. Two days later I was walking into an interview and I felt God saying, this is your gate. This is my provision. And even then, I was resistant. Ask my wife, she'll tell you I left that interview thinking there was no way I wanted that to be God's provision. By 10:30a the next morning I had received an offer above and beyond what I had even asked for.

Now I'm not saying that if you pray and read your Bible God's just going to magically give you A's or land you the perfect job. But if you seek after his will, I truly believe that he will show you favor at home and at school and at work. I believe that when you seek after God's will start to align everything else in your life. I've found that when I start my day off with Psalms and prayer my day is so much more productive and satisfying.

## You

If you walk away with nothing else tonight, hear this, God wants your time. He wants you to sit at his feet and learn to hear his voice. And you can't spend time with him when you're distracted by Netflix, Snapchat, YouTube, or whatever game you're playing on your phone. He doesn't want multitasking spirituality, he wants you. All of you. He wants your undivided attention. He wants you to hear him when he calls your name.

So what do you do? How do you learn to hear his voice? How do you become sensitive to the Holy Spirit? How do you grow your spiritual gifts?

I have a very simple recommendation that I recommend you do.

Wake up every morning and on your drive to school or during breakfast read through one or two chapters of the book of Psalms and then pray. It's gonna be painful and awkward at first. It will feel like pulling teeth. The first three weeks you won't want to do it, or you'll accidentally spend all your time instagram instead of the Bible app.

Which is why many of you may need to delete (actually delete all the games on your phone in front of the students) anything that distracts you off of your phone until you have learned to practice this spiritual discipline.

Over time you will start to really hear God's voice. If you take time and listen. If you take moments of silence, allow the room to get really quiet. Let your heart be still. Turn off Spotify, turn on Do Not Disturb, close your eyes. And just. Listen. (Count to ten at least unless the Spirit prompts you otherwise)

And when you start to know God's will for your life you can start to really advance his kingdom. And that's when the world changin begins.

## We

Worship team if you want to start making your way up to the stage.

What if we were all spending our time wisely. If we weren't wasting every second on entertainment and social media. What if we weren't spending our time consuming, but we spent our time in God's presence seeking his will for our every day walk. I truly believe that amazing things would happen in the city of Omaha. I believe that when your ears are attuned to the voice of God there is nothing you can't do. Miracles are born out of following the will of God and being able to hear in a moment that something amazing is about to happen.

But it all starts by seeking his will and learning to hear his voice.

Let's pray.
