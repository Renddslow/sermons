# Problem
We do not think God's Spirit is for us

# Solution
Receive God's Spirit

Joel 2:28-29

# Introduction
Good evening FSM612 my name is Matt, I'm so excited to talk to you guys tonight. This is probably the most excited I've been to talk to you guys, we are in the middle of a series called _Your Sons and Daughters Will Prophesy_. This series we've been talking about the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and specifically we've been looking at the gift of prophecy. Last week Naomi talked about the purpose of prophecy, how its designed to build up the Church and bring encouragement to people. And just in case you weren't here last week, or just to give a refresher, I want to real quick give a clarifier on what prophecy is and what it is not.

Prophecy simply means to speak for God. It's the Holy Spirit speaking through you to another person. Before Jesus came these "prophecies" were often reminding people to remain faithful to God and warn them of the consequences of not following Him. After Jesus came and died and rose from the dead the prophecies that became common were similar reminders to be faithful to God but also to encourage and build each other up. All prophecies are meant to be tested thoroughly. If someone gives you a prophecy, but it doesn't line up with what God has spoken before in scripture, you're supposed to ignore it and not accept it as truly coming from God.
What prophecy is not is predicting the future. Rarely in Scripture is the future foretold by people who prophesy, and when they did, it is often warning of impending peril for disobeying and rejecting God.

I just wanted to clarify that before we get into our Scripture tonight that what we are not promising you or anyone in this room is the ability to see into the future and know who you're going to marry or how many kids you'll have or what job you'll wind up in.

So with that in mind I want to take us to one of the ancient prophets, a man who spoke on God's behalf, a man by the name of Joel. He wrote a short beautiful book of poetry that contains a promise that was fulfilled and is continuing to be fulfilled to this day. So turn with me if you would to Joel chapter 2, verses 28-29.

> And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit.
Joel 2:28-29

# Me
If you've been in around Flatland or FSM612 for any length of time you may have heard us throw around the term practical Pentecostalism. Pentecostalism is a movement of Churches that believe that when God promised the Church signs and miracles and powers that that was just for the ancient times, but it continues on into 2018. Practical simply means that we believe that God has an order and a purpose for these spiritual gifts in our every day lives.

I did not personally grow up in a church like Flatland. I grew up in a church that believed that sometimes on the missions field a person would be healed of blindness, but speaking in Heavenly languages, or prophesying, or miracles, all of those things had stopped a long time ago. So for a long time growing up I believed that the Holy Spirit was a lot like Jimminy Cricket, a conscience that lived inside of me and told me what was good and what was bad.

When I was about 14 years old I visited a church in my home town with my family that believed in the gifts of the Holy Spirit just like Flatland. I still remember my parents prepping us before we went in, "Now kids, this church believes in speaking in tongues just like in Bible days. So if that happens while we're in there, just know its from God and not something to be afraid of." Well low key, when it did eventually happen during worship time, it scared the snot out of me. There we are singing the 3rd verse of Great I Am and some woman starts yelling loudly in other languages. And it's not like anything I've heard before. When she had stopped, she paused for a moment, and then spoke again in English as if she were translated what she had just said.

All I could remember thinking was, dear God, please don't ever make me do that.

# You
If you're anything like I was, speaking in tongues, and better yet, prophecy can sound like such bizarre, out of reach, scary things. Maybe you've heard about the baptism of the Holy Spirit before and you've been curious, but there's still some fear there. Maybe, you think like some people do that the Holy Spirit isn't for you at all. Maybe you're thinking, gosh you know, I love Jesus and everything, but this Holy Spirit, this tongues, this prophecy thing, it sounds scary. It doesn't sound like something I want to get involved with. I really like the Bible stories and the Gaga ball, but I don't want any of this weirdness.

I think a lot of us are unwilling to receive God's Spirit either because we do not understand His purpose in our lives or the very idea terrifies us.

# God
I want to take a step back for a minute. I think it's only fair that you understand the full picture of what we're talking about. Maybe some of you have heard what I'm gonna tell you about before, but if it's your first time I want to do you the service of showing you how this all works. Why on Earth should you even want God's Spirit let alone tongues and prophecy. Sure, the verse we read, "I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh" is great and all, but why should I even care?

So it all starts on page 1 of the Bible. At the beginning of everything God creates the heavens and the earth, he creates plants and fish and birds. And the prize of all his creation is mankind. God sets up man as ruler over this good earth. At this time God had close personal relationship with his creation. The Bible shows us in Genesis 3:8 that God routinely walked throughout the Garden with man and woman in the evenings. He dwelled among them.

But then on page 3 of the Bible mankind rebels against God and his definition of good and evil and our relationship with God is compromised. No longer can we spend time physically in God's presence. God is so holy anything impure or unclean that would enter his presence would be destroyed.

The rest of the Old Testament describes God's fight to establish and maintain a relationship with one special family, called the Israelites.
Here's the thing, in order to have relationship with someone, its good to have personal intimate relationship with them. It's hard to call someone a friend when you never see them or talk to them. But at the same time, if God were to come down physically to this world, anything unholy would be destroyed.

So God designs a special clean space, a space holy enough that he can dwell among his people. It's called a Tabernacle, or later a Temple. And this Tabernacle sits in the middle of the Israelite camp, so that God is literally at the center of their lives and community. And here is presence, or his Spirit is able to dwell. He dwelled among them. But even when he is present, only a select few people are able to speak to him directly. People called prophets. The prophets are able to hear the voice of God, and faithfully communicate God's message to the people of Israel.

Years pass and Israel again and again rebels against God and his definition of good and not good. Finally God has had enough. He allows a big bad empire to sweep into Israel and destroy their city and sack God's Temple. And for 300 years, God is silent.

300 years after the last prophet speaks to Israel a man from a tiny village starts traveling around his country proclaiming that God's Kingdom has come. This man is Jesus. The Son and very embodiment of God. He dwelled among them. But he didn't just live among them and speak to the people of Israel through prophets. He healed the sick, the lame, the unclean, and the impure. Catch this. The presence of God, the thing that would destroy anything impure if it came even close to him, is now making the impure pure. Now anything that Jesus touches is made Holy. A place where God's spirit can dwell.

So many of you know the story, Jesus is killed and buried. And three days later he returns from the dead and ascends into Heaven. But before he goes he tells his friends, the people whose lives he's touched that he will send his Spirit on them. They wouldn't need a temple or a priest anymore. Because when Jesus has touched your life, the presence of God can live inside you. The Spirit of the living God will dwell among you.

And now you don't need a prophet to tell you what God is saying, if you've repented and believe the Gospel, you have the ability to hear his voice through the power of the Holy Spirit and even encourage and build up fellow Christians. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a restoration of God's relationship with mankind in the Bible. Its an intimacy and bond with our Creator that you can't experience any other way this side of the Resurrection.

# You
So if you're here tonight and you struggle to believe God is for you, I want to tell you it is. Joel, who we read from earlier, says that God will pour out His Holy Spirit on everyone, regardless of their age, gender or social status. Whoever you are, if you believe in Jesus, his Spirit is for you. You just have to choose to receive Him.
