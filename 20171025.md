## Problem
We fail to remain faithful to God in our day-in day-out realtionship

## Solution
Seek God daily

## Intro
This whole series we've been experiencing the life of Daniel. We opened up the series with Daniel as a very young man, probably in his late teen years. Well we're about to catch up with Daniel many many years later. Most scholars believe at the time of this writing he was almost 80 years old. He'd lived a long life, and most of it under captivity of foreign nations.

Now before we start let me give you a little background. We've talked a lot about the empire of Babylon. Throughout most of the Old Testament the Babylon is the very picture of man's sinful nature and ruling and subjugating mankind on his own terms. They're like the Empire from Star Wars.
Well by the time of the events of the story we're about to read, the kingdom of Babylon has been wiped off the map and have been replaced by the Persian Empire lead by King Darius the Great. He had, among his many titles, King of Persia, Pharoah of Egypt, King of Babylon, and King of Kings.

So King Darius had a huge country he was taking care of. In fact you could fit nearly the entire United States inside the kingdom he was ruling and still have space for a hot tub. So Daniel 6 verse 1 starts off by explaining that King Darius set up 120 governors over his kingdom to take care of things like taxes, civil disputes, and local governance. Meanwhile, in order to oversee those 120 governors, he set up 3 high officials to make sure that all of those folks stayed in line. And one of those 3 men was Daniel.

So the Bible says:
> The Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.

So the king would've let Daniel rule the whole kingdom with the only person above him being King Darius himself.

> Then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom (his job), but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him. Then these men said, "We shall find no ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of God."

Here's what's interesting about this. There was nothing that Daniel had done in his 60+ years in Babylon and then Persia that these men could use against him. He had never cheated on a test, or fudged some numbers on a time card, or lied about being sick and staying home from school. There was absolutely nothing they could hold over his head. There were no scandals at work or at home. They couldn't even find a time he had told a dirty joke in the locker room. In fact, he was known to be so faithful to God in both his work life, his home life, and his prayer life that the only way the officials could think to finally get him was if they tried to interrupt his worship of God.

I think the problem that we all experience is that we fail to be faithful to God in our every day lives. 

## Me
In high school I struggled big time with procrastination. I was homeschooled, but I had a weekly co-op, which was a lot like normal school except only one day a week and chances were your mom taught at least one class.
Throughout high school I created a bad habit where I would put off school all week and I would sit around and watch Hulu or draw or play video games. Then at the end of the week, on Wednesday night, I would spring through all my home work. Most Wednesdays throughout the school year I wouldn't even sleep. I would stay up all night and sometimes even do my Latin homework in right before it was my turn to read a translation.
As a result, my grades sufferred, and I particullarly peeved off my Latin teacher. I had a bad reputation for being late on assignments or faking sick because I was two or three weeks behind on homework.
The problem I had was that I didn't want to be faithful day in and day out to do what I was supposed to do. I figured, well if I just do one last sprint, it will all work out. But my relationships sufferred, my grades sufferred, and even my spiritual walk suffered.

## You
How many of you experience the same problem? You struggle to walk with God in your daily life, or you struggle to be faithful with chores, or homework or at work. Maybe your like I was a year ago and you struggle with telling dirty jokes because you value the laughter of your peers over faithfulness to God. // more or maybes

So the men in Daniel's story, the ones who were trying to find something wrong with him, finally decided that if they couldn't find something wrong with Daniel, they would make him do something wrong legally.

6:6
> Then these high officials and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, "O King Darius, live forever! All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions."

And the king agreed. So it happened just like you would've guessed, Daniel is caught praying and the King has no choice but to throw him into the den of lions. But here's the hope, here's the crazy bit. The king says this to Daniel in chapter 6 verse 16, "May your God, whom you continually serve, deliver you."

And Daniel was thrown into the lions den.

## God
You might thing the story ends here? Right, logically it has to. Daniel becomes a martyr, like one of those missionaries who dies preaching the gospel to cannibals. That just makes sense. But the crazy part is, God saves him.
At the break of day, the king arose and ran to the lions den and called out for Daniel. And Daniel yells back, Hey man, I'm all good. 
Verse 22, "My God has sent his angel and shut the lions mouths and they have not harmed me."
Now if you're reading this story and you're saying, what does God want to teach me here? What is God trying to say? How do I solve this problem that you talked about at the beginning about us failing to be faithful to God? I get it, next time I get thrown in the lions den I *will* be faithful to God. No problem, Matt. 
Here's the thing, God will not let you prove your faithfulness in the lions den when you are not proving your faithfulness to him at school. God does not need a whole bunch of students are going to come up to an altar that say, "O God, if given the opportunity to be thrown in a fiery furnace, or get thrown in the lions den, or stand up for God in front of an army of cannibals." He wants men and women who are going to get their karate kid on and train and study and learn and dig in and dive deep every. single. day. 
It's not easy. It's not easy to say, you know what, instead of spending the next hour catching up on Stranger Things, season 2 coming to Netflix October 27, I'm gonna read His Word. I'm gonna pray. I'm gonna miss out on a few things, so I can gain greater things.
I think the key to this whole story comes back to Daniel 6:16, before Daniel is thrown into the lions den Darius says, "May your God whom you continually serve protect you."
Did you catch that? He said, _continually_ serve. That means every day faithfulness. Daniel's big act of standing up for God wasn't even that big to him, because he was always so used to kneeling.

## We
What if we were all like Daniel? That we worked to stay faithful not only in our relationship with God but at home, at school, and at work. What if we took time to practice faithfulness every single day. If we weren't just waiting for our defining moment, but little moments of purposeful action defined who we became.

## You
I want to challenge you as we wrap up this series about the life of Daniel to choose to follow God daily. Discipline yourself to stay in relationship with him. One of the best ways to do that is to just about your Bible to the Psalms every morning and just read one chapter every single day and then pray about it. It won't be easy. I promise. Some days you'll want to skip. Some days you'll over sleep. But to have a faith to stand like Daniel, you have to start on your knees.

Let's pray.
