## Intro
What is up Flatland Student Ministry! I am so excited to talk to you tonight. If you don't know me my name is Matt McElwee, I help lead worship for you guys every week as well as overseeing web and worship tech.
This series has been awesome! Last week Mike VanBuskirk talked about peer pressure and the story of Shadrach, Meshac, and Abednego and the Fiery Furnace. And the week before that Ben Tapper spoke about Daniel fasting as a way to remain faithful to God. Speaking of fasting, how is everyone doing on their fast? Hanging in there?
Well this week we're gonna pickup in Daniel chapter 6, if you wanna head there in your Bible and just put a finger in there to save your place. When we started this series about the life of Daniel, the character of Daniel was just a young man, probably 16 or 17 years old. When we pickup with him in Daniel chapter 6 he is 80 years old. He's served two massive empires, Babylon and now Persia for almost his entire lifetime. And yet through that entire time he has managed remain not only faithful to his job and duties as big wig in the government, he has also remained faithful to God.

The Bible says:
> The Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.

So the king would've let Daniel rule the whole kingdom with the only person above him being King Darius himself. But naturally, some of his coworkers over the years became very jealous. They hated the Daniel was getting blessed and they weren't. So they figured, well let's dig into his history and see if we can find anything in his past that we can bring against him. But they couldn't find anything. There was nothing that Daniel had done in his 60+ years in Babylon and then Persia that these men could use against him. He had never cheated on a test, or fudged some numbers on a time card, or lied about being sick and staying home from school. There was absolutely nothing they could hold over his head. There were no scandals at work or at home. They couldn't even find a time he had told a dirty joke in the locker room. In fact, he was known to be so faithful to God in both his work life, his home life, and his prayer life that the only way the officials could think to finally get him was if they tried to interrupt his worship of God.

I think the problem that we all experience is that we fail to be faithful to God in our every day lives.

## Me
What blows me away about Daniel's story is that he was 16 when he started working in the King's courts and even back then in high school he didn't slack off.

Man in high school I struggled big time with procrastination. I was homeschooled (where my homeschoolers at?), but I had a weekly co-op that met on Thursdays, which was a lot like normal school except only one day a week and chances were your mom taught at least one class.

Throughout high school I created a bad habit where I would put off school all week and I would sit around and watch Hulu or draw or play video games. Then at the end of the week, on Wednesday night, I would sprint through all my homework. Most Wednesdays throughout the school year I wouldn't even sleep. I would stay up all night and sometimes even do my Latin homework in class right before it was my turn to read a translation.
As a result, my grades suffered, and I particularly peeved off my Latin teacher. I had a bad reputation for being late on assignments or faking sick because I was two or three weeks behind on homework.
And this problem of consistency that I had extended beyond my academic life. It also deeply affected my relationship with God. I had this mind set of, well I'll go to church on Sunday or Wednesday night and take care of all my God stuff, and then throughout the week I'll just do whatever I want.

## You
How many of you experience the same problem that I did? Maybe you struggle to keep up with your homework, or you're not applying yourself at work? Maybe you leave everything till the last minute, and not just work stuff. You don't reach out to friends or family until it's almost too late. Maybe your consistency problem is purely spiritual. You only connect with God at the altar but never at home never at work. Maybe you struggle to remain consistent and faithful in your character. You act one way with your parents or at church, but then you go to school and you make dirty jokes and disrespect teachers and talk behind people's backs.

So the men in Daniel's story, the ones who were trying to find something wrong with him, finally decided that if they couldn't find something wrong with Daniel, they would make him do something wrong legally.

6:6
> Then these high officials and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, "O King Darius, live forever! All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions."

And the king agreed. Wouldn't you? I mean who's really gonna break an easy rule like that? It doesn't even say you HAVE to pray to the king, just if you're gonna pray, only pray to the king. No one's really gonna get hurt. So maybe you've already heard it or you've already guessed, but Daniel, being the consistent faithful man he is, hears about the new law and goes straight to his home to pray. And he's caught. And the king has no choice because of the legal complexities of that culture but to follow through on the punishment. But this is the king's man! This is his boy. Daniel, top dog in all of Persia, sentenced to death.
But here's the hope, the king says this to Daniel in chapter 6 verse 16, "May your God, whom you continually serve, deliver you."

And with that Daniel is thrown into the lions den.

## God
You might thing the story ends here? Right, logically it has to. Daniel becomes a martyr, like one of those missionaries who dies preaching the gospel to cannibals. That just makes sense. But the crazy part is, God saves him.

At the break of day, the king gets up and runs to the lions den. Prolly gets down on his hands and knees and peers on in there. It's probably dark, he can't even see the bottom. It prolly smells like a barn. But the king doesn't care, all he wants to know is did his friend survive the night? He yells down, "Daniel! Has your God saved you?"
There's a pause that feels like a life time. And then he hears back, Hey man, I'm all good.

Verse 22, "My God has sent his angel and shut the lions mouths and they have not harmed me."

Now if you're reading this story and you're saying, what does God want to teach me here? What is God trying to say? How do I solve this problem that you talked about at the beginning about us failing to be faithful to God? I get it, next time I get thrown in the lions den I *will* be faithful to God. No problem, Matt.

Here's the thing, God will not let you prove your faithfulness in the lions den when you are not proving your faithfulness to him at school or at home or at work.

God does not need a whole bunch of students who are going to come up to an altar that say, "O God, if given the opportunity to be thrown in a fiery furnace, or get thrown in the lions den, I'll pick you! I'll be faithful then!" He wants men and women who are going to work their butts off and train and study and learn and dig in and dive deep every. single. day.
It's not easy. It's not easy to say, you know what, instead of spending the next hour catching up on Stranger Things, I'm gonna read God's Word. I'm gonna pray.

I'm gonna miss out on a few things, so I can gain greater things.

I think the key to this whole story comes back to Daniel 6:16, before Daniel is thrown into the lions den Darius says, "May your God whom you continually serve, deliver you."
Did you catch that? He said, _continually_ serve. That means every day faithfulness. Daniel's big act of standing up for God wasn't even that big to him, because he was always so used to kneeling.

## You
I want to challenge you as we wrap up this series about the life of Daniel to choose to follow God daily. Discipline yourself to stay in relationship with him. Every morning roll out of bed on your knees and start with prayer. Before you run out to school open your Bible and just read a chapter.

If you need help, I recommend reading one chapter of the book of Psalms every morning. There are 150 chapters in the book, so if you read one every day you'll read the whole book about twice a year. If you've never read the book of Psalms its a collection of prayers and poems that will help you connect to God.
And let's be honest, it won't be easy. Some days you'll forget. Some days you'll want to sleep in an extra 30 minutes instead of waking up getting to know God better. Some days you'll want to skip all together cause you don't think you have time because finals are closing in. Some days you'll just over sleep. But you pick yourself up the next day and the next day to create a routine that becomes a habit of consistent faithfulness. Because the only way to have a faith to stand like Daniel, is to start on your knees.

## We
What if we were all like Daniel?
What if we all worked to stay faithful not only in our relationship with God but at home, at school, and at work. What if we took time to practice faithfulness every single day.

Daniel was able to reshape an entire nation because of his consistent act of faithfulness to his job and his God. And here's how. At the very end of this story, after Daniel is saved, King Darius writes to his entire kingdom and says,

> "Peace be multiplied to you. I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, enduring forever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end. He delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions."

That is what one man was able to do. To change the heart of a nation. Think of how the world would change if we practice that kind of faithfulness. If we weren't just waiting for our big defining moment, but little moments of purposeful action defined who we inevitably became.

Now guys the first step to being faithful and consistent in your relationship with God starts right now in your small groups. So if you'll make your way quietly and reverently to your group. And I encourage you to be authentic and open so that God can do something amazing through you.
