# Problem 
We fail to see accept our calling and push back against the call of God.

# Solution
"I am the Lord's servant, may His will be done"

# Intro
Turn in your Bible's with me to Luke 1 starting at verse 26. If you don't have your Bible with you you can take a look up at the screen, but I mean, why don't you have a Bible with you, this is church.

> In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. 
> And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”
> And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”
> And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.”
> And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.”
P R A Y

When I was about 16 years old I went to a three day youth retreat that my youth group held every year at the beach. It was my first year going, but all of my friends talked highly of it. It was the sort of retreat that was legendary, everyone talked about Road Trip because God always showed up at Road Trip and amazing things always happened.

So I go to Road Trip, and the very first night, the opening service is all about God's calling. And I still remember to this day as the preacher, Pastor Eran Holt, was wrapping up his message he looks out into the crowd of students and says, "and some of you are going to feel God call you do to this, and some of you are going to feel God call you to do that. And someone here is going to feel God call them to ministry." And like that I heard this little voice in my head go, that's you. And I couldn't shake it. And at the end he told anyone who felt God calling them to something to come to the front and they would be annointed with oil.

But the thing was, I argued with God for the next 4 years about that calling. I eventually went to Bible college, which is just kind of what you do if you feel God call you into ministry as a teenager, and even then I would argue with God about my calling. Didn't He know that I wanted to be a filmmaker? I was going to be the next Stephen Spielberg, not a pastor. And this arguing and running and hiding from my calling would cause me endless problems. I dropped out of college twice, changed my major a half-a-dozen times, and wound up in more pain throughout those 4 years than I wish I would have.

And yet through it all, God stayed faithful, and continued to call me on this adventure of ministry.

See I think a problem we often face is that _we all want to be called to something great, but we resist our calling when it doesn't make sense_.

# You
How many of you have had a dream before? Maybe you haven't yet felt specifically called to something by God, but you have things you love to do. Maybe you love to dance or write or draw. Or maybe you love working on computers or doing math or helping younger students with their homework. Maybe you're an incredible drummer or an amazing athlete. Maybe you've even heard whispers during an altar call or prayer time. You hear God saying, hey man or woman, I want you to do something amazing.

But oh man, how does that even make sense? You're 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 years old. Some of you have literally a decade until you're even done with college and God is already starting to prod you and tell you that He wants you to do great things? What is that even about?

How many of you look at the road ahead and all you see is an unlit path with twists and turns that make no sense? I know I did. Sometimes I still do.

Mary had doubts too. In verse 34 of chapter 1 Mary questions this whole arrangement the angel is giving her. This biologically doesn't make sense because Mary isn't even married and has never been with a man. She is so confused.

# God
Here's what's interesting about Mary. Like Naomi talked about in last week's message, Mary was a very young girl to be carrying the savior of the world. It is likely that Mary was 14 or 15 years old. And in an instance God drops a huge calling on her lap. She is to be the mother to God wrapped in human form. 

Can you imagine that? Just take a second and think through that with me. In Jewish society a boy is not considered to reach manhood until he is 13, at which point he will be bar mitzvah which means he has some legal rights and is supposed to keep the law of Moses now. But even then, he is not really supposed to marry until at least 18, but would likely not begin a career until age 20. So here's Mary. She's 14 years old, and she's expected to spend more time than she's been alive caring for and raising the Son of God. She will spend the next 14 years of her life just getting God's son to manhood and he won't even be ready to leave the house.

Not only that, when she asks the angel, how am I going to be able to have a child if I'm not married and haven't been with a man, the angel's just like, don't worry, God will take care of it.

Guys. That's terrifying. There is no context for a miracle like this. Imagine you are standing in this service and God says to you, I want you to lead a church. And you say, sure God, but how will that happen, I don't have a church. And he says, no worries, I'll give you a church, and you walk outside and he literally drops a church out of the sky in the parkinglot with you name on the sign. That's what we're talking about here.

When God calls you to change the world, it is invasive. He is going to get up in your business and totally flip your world upside down. That stuff you have sitting around in your heart, he's gonna shake that up. That addiction you're stuggling with, he's gonna walk right in there and start poking at it. He's got a job for you, and that thing is only gonna hold you back.

God gets really personal with Mary. He tells her she is going to have a baby and she's not even married yet. Which would have been scandalous in ancient Jewish society. In fact it was so scandalous that her fiance planned to end the whole engagement.

But Mary does something that is rather unprecendented in the canon of Biblical heroes that we're used to. Mary doesn't argue, negotiate, or pontificate.She doesn't ask that God pick another woman, she doesn't beg him to wait a few more months so she can have her dream wedding. She lets him interrupt her life so she can fulfill the calling he has planned for her.

Imagine that room for a second. It's quiet. The angel has dropped this crazy bombshell on you. Mary looks at the floor, runs her hands through her hair. A tear slides down her cheek. She clutches her arm and thinks about her parents and how this will affect them. She thinks about her husband-to-be and what he'll think. But then she thinks about the opportunity she has. The Savior of the world, the Messiah brought into the world through her. She looks back at the angel, her voice is choked as she musters, "I am the Lord's servant. May your word be fulfilled."

That's the key.

When God whispers in your ear and says, "Hey, I want to do something great together." You don't question it. You don't argue it. Don't negogiate or try to talk him down. Simply say, "I am the Lord's servant. May your word be fulfilled."

# You
Some of you are probably still sitting there and you're thinking, what does this have to do with me? I am either one, not capable of being pregnant, cuz I'm a guy, or there's no chance God is gonna knock me up with Jesus. That was a one time show. But here's the deal, the same God who called Mary to change the world, is the same God who is here in this room looking to change the world again.

I believe that in this room sitting right in front of me are world changers. Some of you guys are called to be teachers or scientists or politicians. Some of you may even be feeling God nudge you like he did to me 6 years ago as I say that some of you in this room are called to a lifetime of ministry. Maybe as a youth pastor, or an evangelist, a worship leader of a missionary.

So what now? You feel called, but you could be 10 years or more away from really doing that thing that God just called you to do. Well I think the first step is to seal God's calling on you the way that kings were confirmed in the Old Testament. When God called a new king a spiritual leader would annoint their forehead with oil as a symbol of God's calling. So in a moment, we are going to have all of our leaders line up at the front of the stage. And if you feel God calling you to do something great, I want you to come forward and pray with your leader and receive annointing. 

Then what? Well after Mary was filled with the Holy Spirit and she received her calling, she praised God. Further on in Luke chapter 1 Mary sings a beautiful song, praising God for what he was doing in and through her. And in a moment, we're going to worship God as a group, and you'll have the opportunity to solidify your calling by praising God.

The next step is to dig into God's word. Learn to hear his voice. In you need an idea of where to start I highly recommend downloading the Read Scripture app. It's an amazing app that will take you throught the entire Bible in under a year and has incredible videos along with portions of the Bible to help you understand what you're reading better. If that seems like a lot and you just want to get started a little bit, I recommend opening your Bible to the Gospel of John and just starting there.

# We
Guys imagine what could happen if you seized this opportunity that God is giving you. The opportunity to change the world by followng Him and letting him do amazing things in your life. Imagine how we could change our homes, or schools, and our city if each of us accepted the calling God has on us without arguing or grumbling. // clean this up
